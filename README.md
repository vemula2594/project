Time Series Forecasting on FRED Oil Dataset: The project involves forecasting the future trend of crude oil prices based on historical data using time series forecasting techniques. Specifically, the Fb prophet algorithm will be used to build the model and evaluate its performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE. The goal is to provide insights to businesses and investors for making informed decisions about investing in crude oil

Business Objective:

The objective of this project is to forecast the future trend of crude oil prices based on historical data. The project involves a time series forecasting problem where the goal is to predict the future values of crude oil prices. The dataset contains monthly observations of crude oil prices from January 1986 to February 2021.

Dataset: The dataset contains monthly observations of crude oil prices from January 1986 to February 2021. The dataset includes the following variables:

DATE: Date of the observation.
DCOILWTICO: Crude oil prices in U.S. dollars per barrel.

Approach: The project involves building a time series forecasting model to predict the future trend of crude oil prices. In this project, we will use the Fb prophet algorithm to build the model. Fb prophet is a popular open-source algorithm that is specifically designed for time series forecasting. The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Conclusion: Time series forecasting can help businesses and investors make informed decisions about investing in crude oil. By using historical data, a time series forecasting model can be built to predict the future trend of crude oil prices. In this project, we used the Fb prophet algorithm to build the model, and its performance was evaluated using various metrics. The best model can be selected for deployment based on the evaluation metrics.
